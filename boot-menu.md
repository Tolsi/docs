# Boot Menu

TODO: Document older versions (well we can't because the bootloader can't be
downgraded).

The OP-1 has a boot menu for running tests and uploading firmware etc.
To access it hold down the COM button and power on the unit.


# Options in FW v 225 - TE-BOOT v2.13 (and how they are shown on the display)

    TE-BOOT v2.13
    1. Upload firmware
    2. Function test
    
    7. Factory reset
    8. Format drive


Pressing the relevant numbers on the keyboard runs the different functions.


## Additional Options

In addition to the listed functions there are at least two hidden ones:
Shift - 3: Extended function test
Shift - 4: Flip display mode (WARNING: this flips the display vertically. You
can flip it back by rebooting into the boot menu and pressing Shift - 4 again.
